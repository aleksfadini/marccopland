			<h3>Marc Copland On Wikipedia</h3>
			<section class="textbox bordershadow topborder">
				<p> "Copland continues to be an exemplar of the lyrical school of jazz pianism. His music, often noted for its innovative harmonic language, nevertheless is widely regarded as easily accessible to the listener. Many reviewers credit this blend to the pianist's use of dynamics and touch, and his distinctive pedal work. [...] His thirty-five releases make him perhaps the most prolific jazz pianist of the new millennium." - <span><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Copland"> from the wikipedia article about Marc Copland</a></span></p>

"Exploiting harmony and texture to the full, to express the range of a piece’s possibilities, drawing on the legacy of Bill Evans in the way chords lead from one to the next; these were on display. Copland likes to weave a skein of harmony, full of crystalline
 
resonances and then reveal a tune."

									"Copland is a pianist of vast experience, gentle touch and huge harmonic resource, and yet the playing has a touching nakedness about it, his hands fluttering towards one harmony only to change their mind at the last minute and dart to a different chord. "
